# Comparative Analysis of Priority Queues in Graph Algorithms

**CS470 Project 1**

---

## 1. Problem Description & Background

*(Describe the problem: single-source shortest paths and minimum spanning tree; motivation for comparing heap implementations.)*

---

## 2. Algorithm Explanation

### 2.1 Dijkstra's Algorithm

*(Step-by-step description and how the priority queue is used.)*

### 2.2 Prim's Algorithm

*(Step-by-step description and how the priority queue is used.)*

### 2.3 Heap Implementations

- **Binary Heap (baseline)**
- **Pairing Heap**
- **Fibonacci Heap**

*(Brief description of each and key operations: insert, extract-min, decrease-key.)*

---

## 3. Complexity Analysis

*(Time and space complexity for algorithms and each heap; amortized bounds where applicable.)*

---

## 4. Evaluation & Results

*(Experimental setup: graph types, sizes, parameters. Reference `results.txt` and/or include tables/figures. Test cases and correctness checks.)*

---

## 5. Comparative Discussion

- Do Fibonacci heaps provide practical benefits?
- How do pairing heaps compare in practice?
- Which algorithm benefits more from advanced heaps?
- How does graph structure affect performance?
- Why theory and practice may differ
